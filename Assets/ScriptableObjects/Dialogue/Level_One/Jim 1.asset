  - body: It's pretty simple. I wasn't hiding because I was scared. I was hiding
      because I wanted to keep everyone else safe.

  - body: See how I'm glowing red? That's not just for show. I took some of Baba
      Yaga's power. I was going to try and take her down myself.

  - body: But I realized I can't control it. If I go down, I'll just hurt everyone
      else. When Baba Yaga dies, I won't be able to go with the rest of them, either.

  - body: It's ok though. I've made my peace with it. At least I know my friend still
      care about me. I was kind of worried they'd had me after that.  So thanks.
